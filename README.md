# Lightweight VPN Using Raw Sockets

![VPN Banner Image](assets/vpn_banner.png)

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **secure, lightweight, cross-platform VPN** built using **raw sockets** and **TCP/IP networking**. It provides **end-to-end encrypted communication** between two endpoints through an intuitive graphical interface. Unlike traditional VPNs that modify network stacks or require special privileges, this solution works as a user-space application with minimal dependencies.

![VPN Architecture Overview](assets/architecture_diagram.png)

Key advantages:
- **Simple to use**: User-friendly GUI with clear connection indicators
- **No configuration files**: Visual management of all settings
- **Cross-platform**: Works identically on Windows and Linux
- **No installation required**: Run from a single executable file
- **AES-256 military-grade encryption**: Secure your communications

## üî• Features

- **End-to-End Encryption** using AES-256 with CBC mode
- **Raw Socket Communication** for direct TCP packet tunneling
- **Interactive GUI** with real-time connection statistics
- **Cross-Platform Support** (Windows & Linux) with identical behavior
- **Secure Key Management** with multiple sharing options
- **Connection Testing** to validate network connectivity
- **Encryption Verification** to ensure security
- **NAT Traversal** capabilities for connecting through firewalls
- **Network Scanning** to discover potential VPN peers
- **Packet Logging** for monitoring and debugging

## üöÄ How It Works

### Secure Communication Architecture

![Communication Flow Diagram](assets/communication_flow.png)

1. **Sender (Client Mode)**: 
  - Establishes an encrypted tunnel to the receiver
  - Manages encryption key consistency across platforms
  - Monitors connection status and packet delivery
  - Queues and ensures reliable message delivery

2. **Receiver (Server Mode)**:
  - Listens on specified port for incoming connections
  - Handles multiple simultaneous client connections
  - Decrypts and processes incoming data packets
  - Provides identical encryption capabilities as sender

3. **Encryption System**:
  - Uses **AES-256-CBC** with PKCS7 padding
  - Implements random IV generation for each message
  - Ensures cross-platform key consistency
  - Provides multiple verification mechanisms

4. **Connection Management**:
  - Auto-reconnection capabilities
  - Connection testing and verification
  - TCP keepalive for NAT traversal
  - Packet queuing for reliability

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sasukeuchiha14/lightweight-vpn-raw-sockets.git
cd lightweight-vpn-raw-sockets
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

The application requires only two external libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- **pygame**: For the user interface (2.5.2)
- **pycryptodome**: For AES encryption (3.19.0)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

Launch the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will open the graphical interface where you can configure and manage your VPN connections.

## üñ•Ô∏è Using the Application

### Setting Up a Connection

![Connection Setup Screen](assets/connection_setup.png)

1. **Enter IP Address**: 
  - Input the IP address of the machine you want to connect to
  - For local testing, you can use `127.0.0.1`

2. **Select Connection Mode**:
  - **Send Mode**: Acts as the client initiating the connection
  - **Receive Mode**: Acts as the server waiting for connections

3. **Key Management**:
  - **Generate New Key**: Creates a fresh AES-256 encryption key
  - **Select Existing Key**: Choose a previously saved key file
  - **Upload Key**: Load a key shared by your communication partner
  - **Copy Key**: Share your key securely with your partner

![Key Management Interface](assets/key_management.png)

4. **Connection Testing**:
  - Test connectivity before establishing a VPN tunnel
  - Verify the remote machine is reachable
  - Confirm the VPN port is open and accessible

5. **Establish Connection**:
  - Click "Connect" to establish the secure VPN tunnel
  - The status indicator will turn green when connected
  - Real-time statistics will show connection health

### Using the VPN

![Active VPN Connection](assets/active_connection.png)

Once connected, the application will display:
- **Connection Status**: Active/Inactive indicator
- **Statistics**: Packets sent/received, data transferred, connection time
- **Packet Log**: Real-time monitoring of data transfers
- **Test Functions**: Send test packets, verify encryption

To disconnect:
- Click the "Disconnect" button
- The application will properly terminate the connection

## üîí Security & Encryption

### Key Management System

![Encryption Process](assets/encryption_diagram.png)

The VPN uses a sophisticated key management system that ensures consistent encryption across platforms:

- **256-bit AES Keys**: Provides military-grade encryption strength
- **In-Memory Key Storage**: Prevents key leakage and ensures consistency
- **Key Verification**: Cryptographic fingerprinting to verify key matching
- **Platform-Independent Format**: Guarantees identical encryption on all systems
- **Manual Key Exchange**: Keeps keys under user control for maximum security

### Security Features

- **Fully Encrypted Tunnel**: All data is encrypted with AES-256-CBC
- **Random IV Generation**: Each message uses a unique initialization vector
- **Key Fingerprinting**: Visual verification of key consistency
- **Encryption Testing**: Built-in verification of encryption integrity
- **No Central Servers**: Direct peer-to-peer connections only

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

![Troubleshooting Guide](assets/troubleshooting_guide.png)

- **Connection Refused**: 
  - Check if receiver is running
  - Verify firewall settings allow port 8989
  - Use the "Test Connection" feature to diagnose

- **Decryption Errors**: 
  - Ensure both sides use the exact same encryption key
  - Use "Verify Encryption" to check key fingerprints
  - Try the "Force Identical Key" option

- **NAT/Firewall Issues**:
  - Configure port forwarding for port 8989 on your router
  - Try connecting from a different network
  - Check if your ISP blocks custom VPN connections

- **Network Scanning Not Working**:
  - Some networks block ARP scanning
  - Try manually entering the IP address
